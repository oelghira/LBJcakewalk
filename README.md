# LBJcakewalk :cake:
If you've ever listed to Skip Bayless talk basketball, then you've heard Skip describe LeBron's first 9 trips to the NBA finals as a "cake-walk". I've listened to Skip's debates and analysis of players for years. I think I'm one of the few that willingly admit, I'm a fan of his. Skip turns people off. He's critical, cold, and calculated based off of what he calls his "eye test". You could easily say he's had a love-hate relationship with LeBron. As in, he's loved to hate on LeBron since before he ever dribbled a ball in the NBA. He might also have a love-hate relationship with LeBron's fans. His pet name for them is the "blind witnesses". But I've always wondered between Skip's eye test and the blind witnesses, which actually can't see the reality of LeBron's time in the East that lead him to 9 NBA finals appearances and 3 NBA championships? 

In this analysis, I will show the statistics behind LeBron's career in the Eastern Conference, so we can finally answer who really can't see the truth, Skip Bayless or the "blind witnesses". 

**Spoiler: as the title reads....**

## How To Translate A "Cake-Walk" Into Analytics We Can Measure :bar_chart:
Skip never defines what he means by a "cake-walk" but we can interpret it as LeBron had an easier path to the finals by playing in the Eastern Conference instead of the Western Conference. Translating this into terms we can validate using statistics and data, an easier path to the finals would mean we would see **X** things:
  1) Teams in the Western Conference regularly beat teams in the Eastern Conference
  2) Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams regularly beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams 
  3) LeBron lost more to Western Conference playoff teams than Eastern Conference playoff teams

## A Brief Description of LeBron's Career :basketball:

:vs:
:compass:

## 1. Did teams in the West regularly beat teams in the East during LBJ's run?

Looking at regular season matchups of Western Conference teams vs Eastern Conference teams, the West won more than 50% of the games in 14 out of 15 years of LBJ's career in the East. The only exception was the 2008-2009 season (2009 on the chart above) where the East only managed to just barely win more than 50% of the games against the West. Skip's "eye test" seems to have some credibility and there isn't much room for debate on this point. In the regular season, the West was the better conference. But even Skip would admit the regular season doesn't mean much, it's the playoffs that count!

## 2. Did Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams regularly beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams? 
**Work on this title...**
The playoffs is where it really matters! This where we really get to see which team, in a best of 7 game competition, has what it takes to get a chance at the title. The only problem for us is that we want to compare the two conferences and they don't play eachother in the playoffs until the finals. The best we can do is focus our comparison from conference against conference to playoff teams against playoff teams.
