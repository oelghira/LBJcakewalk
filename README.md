# LBJcakewalk
If you've ever listed to Skip Bayless talk basketball, then you've heard Skip describe LeBron's first 9 trips to the NBA finals as a "cake-walk". I've listened to Skip's debates and analysis of players for years. I think I'm one of the few that willingly admit, I'm a fan of his. Skip turns people off. He's critical, cold, and calculated based off of what he calls his "eye test". You could easily say he's had a love-hate relationship with LeBron. As in, he's loved to hate on LeBron since before he ever dribbled a ball in the NBA. He might also have a love-hate relationship with LeBron's fans. His pet name for them is the "blind witnesses". But I've always wondered between Skip's eye test and the blind witnesses, which actually can't see the reality of LeBron's time in the East that lead him to 9 NBA finals appearances and 3 NBA championships? 

In this analysis, I will show the statistics behind LeBron's career in the Eastern conference, so we can finally answer who really can't see the truth, Skip Bayless or the "blind witnesses".
