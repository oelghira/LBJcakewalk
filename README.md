# LBJcakewalk :cake:
**So far, so good, but re word to focus on a cake walk. In my wording it sounds like this is analysis of skip's eye test and less about the cake walk**  
If you've ever listed to Skip Bayless talk basketball, then you've heard Skip describe LeBron's first 9 trips to the NBA finals as a "cake-walk". I've listened to Skip's debates and analysis of players for years. I think I'm one of the few that willingly admit, I'm a fan of his. Skip turns people off. He's critical, cold, and calculated based off of what he calls his "eye test". You could easily say he's had a love-hate relationship with LeBron. As in, he's loved to hate on LeBron since before he ever dribbled a ball in the NBA. He might also have a love-hate relationship with LeBron's fans. His pet name for them is the "blind witnesses". But I've always wondered between Skip's eye test and the blind witnesses, which actually can't see the reality of LeBron's time in the East that lead him to 9 NBA finals appearances and 3 NBA championships? 

In this analysis, I will show the statistics behind LeBron's career in the Eastern Conference, so we can finally answer who really can't see the truth, Skip Bayless or the "blind witnesses". 

**Spoiler: as the title reads....**

## How To Translate A "Cake-Walk" Into Analytics We Can Measure :bar_chart:
Skip never defines what he means by a "cake-walk" but we can interpret it as LeBron had an easier path to the finals by playing in the Eastern Conference instead of the Western Conference. Translating this into terms we can validate using statistics and data, an easier path to the finals would mean we would see these 3 measureable events:
  1) Teams in the Western Conference regularly beat teams in the Eastern Conference
  2) Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams regularly beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams 
  3) LeBron lost more to Western Conference playoff teams than Eastern Conference playoff teams

## A Brief Description of LeBron's Career :basketball:

:vs:
:compass:

## 1. Did teams in the West regularly beat teams in the East during LBJ's run?

<br/>  
**(west won on average 56.6% of games in this time...do i need to mention it somewhere?)**
Looking at regular season matchups of Western Conference teams vs Eastern Conference teams, the West won more than 50% of the games in 14 out of 15 years of LBJ's career in the East. The only exception was the 2008-2009 season (2009 on the chart above) where the East managed to just barely win more than 50% of games against the West. Skip's "eye test" seems to have some credibility and there isn't much room for debate on this point. In the regular season, the West was the better conference. But even Skip would admit the regular season doesn't mean much, it's the playoffs that count!

## So the West won the regular season, but what happened with the playoff teams? 
## 2. Did Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams regularly beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams? 
**Work on this title...**
This where we really get to see which team, in a best of 7 game competition, has what it takes to get a chance at the title. The only problem for us is that we want to compare the two conferences and they don't play eachother in the playoffs until the finals. The best we can do is focus our comparison from conference against conference to playoff teams against playoff teams. 
<br/>

<br/>  
The chart above paints an even clearer picture that the West's top teams won much more against the East's top contenders in every year Lebron James played in the Eastern Conference. In our first comparison of all teams in the West playing against all teams in the East, the West won an average of 56.6%. When we narrow our focus to the top 8 teams in the West against the top 8 teams in the East, the West's annual average win percentage increases to 58.2%. **Translating that into English, that increase in annual win percentage of 1.6% of top 8 teams against top 8 teams means the West's best won just over 2 more games a year against playoff teams in the East than the entire Western Conference playing against the whole Eastern Conference. (maybe work on re-wording)** The data seems to give us a clearer view of what Skip must have seen with his "eye test". But if it were so obvious that the West was the superior conference, we would be able to see this by comparing the bottom 4 playoff teams in the West against the top 4 playoff teams in the East. 
<br/>

<br/>  
The chart above is almost like the icing on the cake. Comparing the West's bottom 4 seeds against the East's top 4 seeds, the average annual win percentage by the bottom 4 playoff teams is 59.9%! **thats higher than...** We could also compare top 4 seed against top 4 seed in each conference, but that seems like overkill at this point. Skip's analysis of LeBron having a "cake-wall" through 15 seasons in the East seems right on the money. The data does not lie to us. The competition LeBron went through to get to the NBA finals 9 times out of the East was not as difficult as the path the Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs, OKC Thunder, or Dallas Mavericks had to take. 

With this in mind, I want to remind us that this would not even be a question asked if one man hadn't accomplished so much that we had to wonder how was it possible? LeBron is an exceptional player, so before we conclude that Skip was right this whole time and LeBron really had a "cake-walk" to the finals we need to focus on how he and his teams compared to the tougher Western Conference.

## 3. LeBron lost more to Western Conference playoff teams than Eastern Conference playoff teams
## 3. So Did LeBron's teams lose more to the West than the East?
