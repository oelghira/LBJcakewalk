# LBJcakewalk :cake:
If you've ever listed to Skip Bayless talk basketball, then you've heard Skip describe LeBron's first 9 trips to the NBA finals as a "cake-walk". I've listened to Skip's debates and analysis of players for years. I think I'm one of the few that willingly admit, I'm a fan of his. Skip turns people off. He's critical, cold, and calculated based off of what he calls his "eye test". You could easily say he's had a love-hate relationship with LeBron. As in, he's loved to hate on LeBron since before he ever dribbled a ball in the NBA. He might also have a love-hate relationship with LeBron's fans. His pet name for them is the "blind witnesses". But I've always wondered between Skip's eye test and the blind witnesses, which actually can't see the reality of LeBron's time in the East that lead him to 9 NBA finals appearances and 3 NBA championships? 

In this analysis, I will show the statistics behind LeBron's career in the Eastern Conference, so we can finally answer who really can't see the truth, Skip Bayless or the "blind witnesses". 

**Spoiler: as the title reads....**

## How To Translate A "Cake-Walk" Into Analytics We Can Measure :bar_chart:
Skip never defines what he means by a "cake-walk" but we can interpret it as LeBron had an easier path to the finals by playing in the Eastern Conference instead of the Western Conference. Translating this into terms we can validate using statistics and data, an easier path to the finals would mean we would see **X** things:
  1) Teams in the Western Conference regularly beat teams in the Eastern Conference
  2) Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams regularly beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams 
  3) LeBron lost more to Western Conference playoff teams than Eastern Conference playoff teams
